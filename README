wiim-el: Emacs Lisp wmiirc script

The name says it all, this program puts Emacs in charge of wmii,
allowing elisp-based configuration and manipulation.

The code reflects the quick and dirty development process and will be
subject to many changes. It works as-is though.

To use it put wmii.el somewhere in the load-path and add something
like the following to init.el:

(require 'wmii)
(setq wmii-focus-colors (wmii-color-tuple "ghost white" "SlateGray4" "gray50"))
(setq wmii-normal-colors (wmii-color-tuple "SlateGray4" "ghost white" "gray70"))
(setq wmii-font "-xos4-terminus-medium-r-normal--16-*-72-72-c-80-iso10646-1")
(setq wmmi-term "urxvt")
(wmii-xwrite "/ctl" "bar on top")
(wmii-init)

Only the first and last lines are fundamental (and the loading process
will also change one of this days).

On wmii's end it is necessary to prevent it from loading the default
shell-based wmiirc. This can be acomplished by launching it with the
"-r" flag, e.g.

wmii -r ~/.wmii/wmiirc_emacs

A sample wmiirc_emacs is also included, which merely starts emacs (the
initialisation is done *after* emacs is running, in init.el as per
above). This is merely an example and more elaborate starting
strategies are possible (e.g. using emacsclient, running emacs in
batch mode, etc).
